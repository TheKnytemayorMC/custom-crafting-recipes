# custom-crafting-recipes

This repository includes 'pack.zip', an example data pack.

You may use all of these in your world and server, but please include, in
the video description, something telling the viewers that my datapacks are included.

What exactly is the 'pack.zip'?
This file is a data pack that uses the latest Minecraft 1.20.5 crafting
recipe features, including item components so far.
